Overview
Monitoring of network services (SMTP, POP3, HTTP, ICMP (ping)[4]
Limited monitoring of host resources (processor load, disk usage) on a majority of network operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and Linux through agent-based testing
Plugin design that allows users to easily develop their own service checks depending on needs, by using PHP (or other languages or scripts wrapped in PHP)
Some ability to define network host hierarchy using "master" nodes allowing link failures to suspend monitoring[5]
Event-based system allowing failure notifications to be sent in customised email (suitable for email-to-SMS) or to utilise third-party notification scripts via a plug-in
Ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events for proactive problem resolution
Automatic data retention cleanups
Full web-interface for management and monitoring
Ability to "publish" views and graphs within third-party web pages
